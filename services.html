     <h3>Hair Cut</h3>
     <hr>
    <p>A great haircut can make you look and feel great,
    <p>  and it is never too early to find the right style.
    <p> There are many boys haircuts that are stylish and cool,
    <p>with varying maintenance levels. Some are fuss-free and
    <p> create a relaxed aesthetic, while others appeal to a little
    <p>gentleman and look polished and neat. Boys do not need to
    <p>  opt for the same standard cut that doesn’t allow them to
    <p>  express their personality or highlight the natural 
    <p>  of their hair. Some looks can be adapted to suit any face 
    <p>, hair type, length and texture, and age.</p>
